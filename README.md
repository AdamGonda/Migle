# Migle

It is a collaborative agile project planner.

I liked to learn React, Redux, Firebase and a lot's of other stuff on a bigger project so I thought I will create a Trello copy because that way I wouldn't have to bother to try to come up with the product idea, just with an implementation. But I decided to create something else because I found a use case for it, a real-life problem.

So we used google spreadsheets so far to organize our projects that way we get features like:
- Keep the user stories organized. 
- More people can edit a document at the same time.
- Charts about our sprints.
- See who works on what.
- What stage a task is in.

Stuff like that, so I thought it is fairly well defined so I can make an app that solves these problems plus it gives extra features like:
- Real-time messaging.
- Ease of use.
- Nice UX/UI.

### Disclaimer: 
You can find the API key to the database in the repo, it is, of course, not acceptable for a real-world project and probably I will change it later :D

### Here is a UI concept to get an idea of how I imagine the stuff so far:

### This project is my main focus so If your interested check back later, hopefully you will be able to see some progress :D
