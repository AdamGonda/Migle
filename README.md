I liked to learn React, Redux, Firebase and a lot's of other stuff on a bigger project so I thought I will create a Trello copy because that way I wouldn't have to bother to try to come up with the product idea, just with an implementation. But I decided to create something else because I found a use case for it, a real-life problem.

So we used google spreadsheets so far to organize our projects that way we get features like:
- Keep the user stories organized. 
- More people can edit a document at the same time.
- Charts about our sprints.
- See who works on what.
- What stage a task is in.

Stuff like that, so I thought it is fairly well defined so I can make an app that solves these problems plus it gives extra features like:
- Real-time messaging.
- Ease of use.
- Nice UX/UI.
