It is a collaborative agile project planner.

I liked to learn React, Redux, Spring, Web sockets and a lot's of other stuff on a bigger project so I thought I will create a Trello copy because that way I wouldn't have to bother to try to come up with the product idea, just with an implementation. But I decided to create something else because I found a use case for it, a real-life problem.

So we used google spreadsheets so far to organize our projects that way we get features like:
-Keep the user stories organized. 
-More people can edit a document at the same time.
-Charts about our sprints.
-See who works on what.

-Real-time messaging.
-Ease of use.
-Nice UX/UI.
-Specialized purpose.
